# About

Introducing the Decentralized Ticket Marketplace, a smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC721 standard to manage NFT (Non-Fungible Token) tickets. This innovative marketplace provides a secure and transparent platform for handling ticket transactions for various occasions and events. Through the smart contract, users can easily create occasions, specifying essential details such as occasion name, ticket cost, maximum ticket availability, date, time, and location. These occasions are stored on the blockchain, ensuring immutability and accessibility for all participants.

Once an occasion is listed, users can seamlessly purchase tickets for their desired events. Each ticket represents a unique NFT, providing a digital representation of the purchased ticket. By leveraging the power of NFTs, users gain ownership over their event tickets, enabling easy transferability, verification, and secure storage. With this decentralized ticket marketplace, event organizers can reach a broader audience, while attendees enjoy a frictionless ticketing experience, free from intermediaries and counterfeit concerns. Embrace the future of ticketing with the NFT-powered Decentralized Ticket Marketplace.

Key Features:

- Creation of occasions with detailed event information.
- Purchase of unique NFT tickets for listed occasions.
- Secure ownership and transferability of event tickets through NFTs.
- Elimination of counterfeit ticketing and intermediary involvement.
- Transparent and immutable storage of occasion data on the Ethereum blockchain.

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `npx hardhat --version
` and you see a response like `2.12.7`

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/athikaf/Ticket-Generator.git
npm install
```

# Usage

## Start a local node

```
npx hardhat node
```

## Deploy

This will default to your local node. You need to have it running in another terminal in order for it to deploy.

```
npx hardhat run --network hardhat scripts/deploy.js
```

## Testing

In this repo we cover unit testing

```
npx hardhat test
```

# Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

1. Setup environment variables

You'll want to set your `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example`.

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). **NOTE:** FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
  - You can [learn how to export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
- `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: This is url of the goerli testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

- `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY`: The free API of your account (like from [coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)).

Optionally, add your `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` if you want to verify your contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

1. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some tesnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.

2. Deploy

`npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia`
